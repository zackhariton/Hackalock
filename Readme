Hackalock was intended to be a dynamically partitioned, horizontally scaling, distributed lock manager. A system which, to the best of my knowledge, has never been built before. Unfortunately distributed systems are hard and I wasn't able to get an actual distributed version running. I do however have a very simple mocked version of the system which runs locally and tests a few basic scenarios. It doesn't do any concurrent requests, network partitions, or hardware failures. AKA it doesn't do any of the interesting parts of distributed systems. But hey its better than nothing.
